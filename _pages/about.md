<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome! I am Tony, a final-year Systems and Electronics Engineering student at Universidad de los Andes and a researcher at the Center of Research and Formation in Artificial Intelligence (CinfonIA). Currently, I am a research intern at Cornell University and recently started to collaborate on research with a professor from the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). My experience centers on NLP and GenAI, with a strong focus on developing reasoning capabilities for multimodal agents (image/video) to address complex real-world tasks and understand inherent semantics. My ongoing research and recent publications support this passion.

[Semantic Shift Detection for 19th Century Spanish](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lchange-1.4.pdf)

**Tony Montes**, Laura Manrique-G√≥mez, Rub√©n Manrique

[**Code**](https://github.com/historicalink/SSD-Old-Spanish) 
- Implemented a pipeline for detection of semantic shifts (changes in meaning) between two datasets in the same language, employing contextual word embeddings with BERT (fine-tuned on the historical dataset) and KMeans clustering.
- Tested the solution with the LSCDiscovery Binary Change Detection task, among different BERT-like models and clustering algorithms, and checked it's performance over 250 historic words.
- Compiled the biggest 19th-century Spanish dataset with ~180M tokens, within 3 different sources: Project Gutenberg, The British Library Books, and LatamXIX.

[19th Century Latin American Spanish Newspaper Corpus with LLM OCR Correction](https://aclanthology.org/2024.nlp4dh-1.13.pdf)

Laura Manrique-G√≥mez, **Tony Montes**, Arturo Rodr√≠guez-Herrera, Rub√©n Manrique

[**Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Flaglab/latam-xix)
- Developed a semi-automated methodology for correction of OCR errors and detection of surface forms in historical datasets, employing LLMs and a diff algorithm.
- Applied the methodology to LatamXIX, a 19th-century Latin American Spanish newspaper corpus developed by _Laura Manrique-G√≥mez_, achieving the expected results checked by experts.
